Project dataset containing sample of FR24 data

adsb - variable description 

1. AircraftId: The model or type of the aircraft. In this case, "B738" refers to the Boeing 737-800 model.


2. Latitude: The current latitude (geographical coordinate) of the aircraft in degrees. For this data, it's 14.6000°.


3. Longitude: The current longitude (geographical coordinate) of the aircraft in degrees. Here, it's -90.5000°.


4. Track: The aircraft's heading or direction of travel in degrees, where 0° is north, 90° is east, 180° is south, and 270° is west. In this case, the aircraft is heading west (270°).


5. Altitude: The aircraft's current altitude in feet. The value 6000 means the aircraft is flying at 6,000 feet.


6. Speed: The aircraft's ground speed in knots (nautical miles per hour). Here, the aircraft is traveling at 400 knots.


7. Squawk: The transponder code assigned by air traffic control (ATC) for identification on radar. The value is "4321", a specific code for the aircraft's current flight.


8. RadarId: The identifier for the radar or data source that tracked the aircraft. In this case, "300" refers to a specific radar station.


9. Type: The aircraft's model designation, which is also listed as "B738" (Boeing 737-800).


10. Registration: The aircraft’s unique registration number. Here, "N826NN" identifies this specific aircraft.


11. LastUpdate: The timestamp of the last recorded data update, in Unix time format (seconds since January 1, 1970). The value "1696350840" corresponds to the last recorded time.


12. Origin: The ICAO code of the airport from which the flight originated. "GUA" refers to La Aurora International Airport in Guatemala City.


13. Destination: The ICAO code of the destination airport. "MIA" refers to Miami International Airport in Miami, Florida.


14. Flight: The flight number. "AAL476" indicates American Airlines flight 476.


15. Onground: A flag indicating whether the aircraft is on the ground or in the air. A value of "0" means the aircraft is airborne.


16. Vspeed: The aircraft's vertical speed, typically measured in feet per minute. A value of "0" means the aircraft is not climbing or descending.


17. Callsign: The radio callsign used by ATC and pilots for communication. "AAL476" is the callsign for American Airlines flight 476.


18. SourceType: The source of the data. In this case, "ADS-B FR24 receivers" refers to data collected from ADS-B (Automatic Dependent Surveillance-Broadcast) receivers, specifically from FlightRadar24.


19. ETA: Estimated Time of Arrival. A value of "0" here may indicate that ETA data is not currently available.
